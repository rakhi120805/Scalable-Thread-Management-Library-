# Scalable Thread Management Library

## Overview
This project implements a scalable thread management library in C, designed to handle dynamic thread creation, task execution, and resource optimization. It includes a thread pool, task queue, synchronization mechanisms, and performance evaluation tools. The project is developed collaboratively by a team using POSIX threads (pthreads) on a Linux environment (WSL Ubuntu).

## Files and Contributions

### Thread.c
- **Purpose**: Implements basic thread creation and execution.
- **Contributor**: Rakhi (@rakhi120805)
- **Details**: This file (originally `first.c`) demonstrates creating and joining a single thread using pthreads. It serves as the foundation for understanding thread lifecycle management.

### thread_manager.c
- **Purpose**: Implements a producer-consumer model for task execution.
- **Contributor**: Rakhi (@rakhi120805)
- **Details**: This file uses a thread-safe message queue with a linked list to manage tasks. A producer thread adds tasks, and a consumer thread executes them, demonstrating dynamic task scheduling.

### taskqueue.c
- **Purpose**: Manages a task queue for thread pool operations.
- **Contributor**: [Anushka] (22anushkaroy)
- **Details**: This file likely provides a task queue implementation, possibly used by `thread_manager.c` or other modules for scheduling tasks across threads.

### Synchronization.c
- **Purpose**: Implements synchronization mechanisms for thread safety.
- **Contributor**: [Sneha Tiwari] (Snehatiwarideepti)
- **Details**: This file likely includes mutexes, condition variables, or semaphores to ensure thread-safe operations across the library, such as in task queuing or shared resource access.

### performance.c
- **Purpose**: Evaluates the performance of the thread management system.
- **Contributor**: [Anushka] (22anushkaroy)
- **Details**: This file likely measures metrics like task execution time, thread utilization, or throughput, providing insights into the library’s efficiency.

## Team Members
- **Rakhi (@rakhi120805)**: Implemented `Thread.c` and `thread_manager.c`, focusing on thread creation and producer-consumer task execution.
- **[Anushka] (22anushkaroy)**: Developed `taskqueue.c` for task management.
- **[Sneha Tiwari] (@Snehatiwarideepti)**: Created `Synchronization.c` for thread safety.
- **[Anushka] (@22anushkaroy)**: Built `performance.c` for performance evaluation.

## How to Build and Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rakhi120805/thread-lib.git
   cd thread-lib


   ## Integration Update
- All modules (`Thread.c`, `taskqueue.c`, `Synchronization.c`, `performance.c`) have been integrated into `thread_manager.c`.
- **New Structure**:
  - `Thread.c`: Basic thread test.
  - `MessageQueue.c`: Linked-list-based task queue with priority and timeout (from `Synchronization.c` and `thread_manager.c`).
  - `Performance.c`: Performance metrics (execution time, throughput).
  - `thread_manager.c`: Main driver with thread pool, task execution, and performance tracking.
- The system now supports:
  - Basic thread creation.
  - Priority-based task scheduling.
  - Task timeout (2 seconds).
  - Performance measurement.
  - Dynamic thread count.
 
  ## Build Notes
- The project uses `clock_gettime` for performance timing, which requires `<time.h>`.
- On some systems, you may need to link the real-time library with `-lrt`. Use the following command if the default fails:
  ```bash
  gcc -o thread_manager thread_manager.c Thread.c MessageQueue.c Performance.c -pthread -lrt

  
---

### Additional Notes
- **Why the Error Happened**: `<time.h>` was missing in `Performance.c`, so the compiler couldn’t find the definitions for `struct timespec`, `clock_gettime`, and `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`.
- **Modern Systems**: On WSL Ubuntu (which is typically a recent version of Ubuntu), `-lrt` is usually not needed because `clock_gettime` is part of `libc`. However, I included the `-lrt` option as a fallback for compatibility.
- **Future Improvement**: You could add error handling for `clock_gettime` to make the code more robust:
  ```c
  double get_current_time() {
      struct timespec ts;
      if (clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &ts) != 0) {
          perror("clock_gettime failed");
          return 0;
      }
      return ts.tv_sec + ts.tv_nsec / 1e9;
  }
