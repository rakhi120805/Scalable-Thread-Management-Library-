        <h2>What It Does</h2>
        <p>
            The Scalable Thread Management Library is a C-based project that manages threads efficiently using a thread pool. It allows you to schedule tasks with priorities, handle task timeouts, and measure performance metrics like execution time and throughput. This library is ideal for applications that need to process multiple tasks concurrently while optimizing resource usage.

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
            The library uses a thread pool to manage a fixed number of worker threads. Tasks are added to a priority-based queue, and threads pick up tasks based on their priority. A timeout checker ensures tasks don’t run too long, and performance metrics track the system's efficiency.
